If you're seeing this message via the serial monitor on your Teensy, it means that for whatever reason, your Teensy hasn't been able to find or get valid info from the ublox chips. Review the flashing process [here](https://github.com/AgHardware/Boards/wiki/configuring-the-zed-f9p) and ensure the correct config files are loaded.
