You need to specify when ordering which steering boss you require (and let them know if you require additional ones). Pay attention to the aliexpress link, the "View more" bit will list all the adapter types. NOTE: this list below might be out of date as more models are added, so look for this chart on the aliexpress link!!

Also, there is a newer motor with 12-pin connection but as far as I can see, it doesn't offer much over the 7-pin one at this time, we'll update this document when it's available.

You’ll be powering 12V to pin 1, and GND to pin2 - and don’t power this through the AOG board! Put it on its own supply with a big huge “OFF!” switch for safety.

Pin 6 (CANH) goes to pin 16 on ampseal and pin 7 (CANL) goes to pin 17.

You’ll need a modified firmware and while the hope is that this eventually goes to mainstream, at the moment it’s still considered as in-testing, so I haven’t submitted a PR to the main branch as yet.

You can find my modified firmware [here](https://github.com/lansalot/AgOpenGPS_Boards/blob/Keya/TeensyModules/V4.1/Firmware/AOG-Keya-CANBUS.hex) but make life easier by using [AOG-Config-O-Matic!](https://github.com/lansalot/AOGConfigOMatic/releases)
