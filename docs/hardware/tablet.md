# Tablet

You want a tablet that's rugged and has a screen that won't be impaired in direct sunlight. The Panasonic Toughpad range can be bought very cheaply, refurbished, on ebay. Above 400 nits is a good experience.

Look for one with at least 8gb memory, preferably an SSD hard drive and if you can find one with built-in ethernet all the better (otherwise you'll need a USB dongle to connect it to the AOG board). Ideally, an HD screen (1920x1080) would be good, but the standard 1366x768 is still OK for AOG.

Make sure it has wifi for tethering to your phone, or USB for a hard-tether if not (preferably not of course).

**MOST IMPORTANTLY - it must be a WINDOWS tablet. Android will NOT work.** The version of Windows isn't important, 10 or 11 will be fine. A tablet that uses the ARM processors is also not suitable - Intel or AMD only I'm afraid.

Make sure you get a charger, and you may need to go looking for a 12V charger as well of course (unless your machine has a 110/240V inverter?). If you find the right seller, you can even claim the VAT back.

## Models of note:

* Panasonic Toughpad CF-D1 (1280x720 - on the limit for screen size)
* Panasonic Toughpad FZ-G1 (1920x1200)
* Panasonic Toughbook FZ-G2 (1920,1080, well spec'd usually)
* Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1 (7" screen, a little small)
* Dell 5290

Models to STAY AWAY FROM

* Panasonic FZ-A1 (android, no use!)

## Charger for the tablet:
Most tablets that come with USB-C require charging from 20V and require a 45-65W charger. As most of us has 12V only in the cab finding a charger can be tricky.
These are the ones tested and working with Panasonic, *tho note that you can run Panasonic direct from battery using [these plugs](https://cpc.farnell.com/pro-power/ppw00029/lead-dc-power-2-5mm-plug-to-plug/dp/PW03428), no need for charger* :
