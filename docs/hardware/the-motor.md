# The motor

You have 2 choices here: 24V or 12V

## Phidgets 24V motor
If you're going down the steering-wheel-motor route, the Phidgets is the one to buy. There are alternatives, but PotatoFarmer has made an excellent 3D-printed holder that fits it nicely (see below)

Specs:  24V 600RPM 5.1kgcm torque

Note that if you're using a 24V motor as above, you'll need a 12V-24V step-up converter, sample here.

## MFA 12V motor

This is mostly used by the French guys you can source it from a couple places in europe.
You can get roughly a 30% discount from the manufacturer when directly ordering from them but you need to order 5+.

Specs:  4:1 ratio 12V 1300RPM 3.3kgcm 

(you can likely add an extra 10% as the tractors voltage is around 13-14V) which makes this less powerful than phidgets but good enough for U-Turn

Make sure the v2 AIO board has extra traces as this can easily eat 5-7 amperes at peak.

## Aliexpress 12V motor

## Others
We've seen all kind of 12V motors being used from drills to Opel Corsa C electric servo. Choice is yours.

# Mounting the motor

PotatoFarmer has made an awesome 3D printed gearset and motor holder, check that out here:

STL for the MFA motors small gear: (don't use PLA for it go with PETG or TPU)

# Wiring the motor
Use at least 0.75mm2 wires. You'll have a hard time putting a 1.5mm2 into the Ampseal connector. So likely 1mm2 is good enough.
Which wire goes where?! You can invert the direction from AgOpenGPS so don't worry about it.
V4 board can easily handle the 12V motors without extra traces.
Use Pin18 on the ampseal as that's a direct connection to cytron. Add a 10A fuse before it.

## Freewheeling mods

When the motor is not used it acts as a resistance. When the cytron is connected it acts like a brake. You have a few options.
Playing with electronics is risky so do it at your own risk.

## Free wheel mod v0

Bricbrics holder can physically detach the motor.

## Free wheel mod v1

Get a proper relay such as: Bosch 0332019110
Use the Lock pin which is a switched 12V output to trigger it. Disconnect one of your motor wires.

## Free wheel mod v2

This new AiO board has the option of connecting pwm2 to the cytron for the freewheeling mod.
