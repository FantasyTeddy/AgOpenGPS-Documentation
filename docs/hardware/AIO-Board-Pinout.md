So, you'll be needing some Ampseal connectors.
Please note that ground pins of 4,21,23 are common and shared, thus they can be interchanged.

|Component|Pin|Description|
|---------|---|-----------|
|Battery +  | 22 | +12v in, use the appropriate fuse! |
|Battery -  | 23 (4,21) | Ground |
|WAS 5V     | 1 | 5V output for Wheel Angle Sensor |
|WAS GND    | 4 (21,23) | Ground for WAS |
|WAS Low    | 3 | Used for the Differential setup in AgOpenGPS |
|WAS High   | 2 | Used for Single with GND and Differential with WAS Low |
|Steerswitch| 8 | Can be used with a switch or a button to have a physical button to enable / disable autosteer. Basically it allows to disable the steering. Has to be connected to ground. (4,21,23) |
|Workswitch | 9 | Can be used to turn sections on / off. Has to be connected to ground. (4,21,23) |
|Remote/Pressure|10| Used for pressure sensor in valves or encoder in motor. Ground: (4,21,23)|
|Left       | 5 | Power output for motor / valves (Danfoss Signal) |
|Right/Lock | 6 | Power output for motor / valves (Lock was only available on AIO boards v2.5 and lower since V4 board lock is no more present)  |
|Lock       | 7 | Switched 12V output when autosteer is enabled. Can be used to activate the hydraulic valve through a relay or power Danfoss valve.|
|CanH1      | 16 | Can High for channel 1 |
|CanL1      | 17 | Can Low for channel 1 |
|Speed +    | 14 | Output speed pulse + |
|Speed -    | 15 | Output speed pulse - |
|A12        | 11 | !Use at your own risk! Unprotected connection to Teensy pin A12 |
|A13        | 12 | !Use at your own risk! Unprotected connection to Teensy pin A13 |
|A14        | 13 | !Use at your own risk! Unprotected connection to Teensy pin A14 |
|+12v out   | 20 | 12V output (use it only for limited load maximum 1A) |
| V2 board: |    |   |
|CanH2      | 18 | Can High for channel 2 |
|CanL2      | 19 | Can Low for channel 2 |
| V4 board: |    |   |
|Cytron  IN | 18 | V4 board: Cytron Input (up to 10A fuse) 12/24V |
|NC         | 19 | NC |
