For the actual pinout see [here](AIO-Board-Pinout)

A crimping tool: Yato YT-2255

Let's build a wiring harness that will look like this:

# Shopping list
For this we need:
* Ampseal 23 female connector + Tail sheath https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000383252937.html
* For test bench or in case you're not fan of crimping you can get Ampseal assembled https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004890887135.html
* Fuse holder: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005014786356.html
* We also added an extra male + female just in case you want to be able to take it apart under the cab https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000357094249.html
* Main Switch with GPS logo: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002668770185.html (Get the switch + plug and maybe a holder depending on your tractor _Number 30 is the GPS logo (always double check!)_
* Connector for the motor: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000298353276.html (it comes with pins that you can crimp with a normal crimper)
* Steering: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000306602294.html (16mm, Momentary Reset + get the socket too!)  put a note for _C02 that's heated steering (always double check!)_
* Some braiding: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33046800962.html (16mm will do)
* Shrink tube: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003700916035.html (16mm for braiding  + maybe 4 and 8mm)

* Connector for the [wheel angle sensor](wheel-angle-sensor) of your choice take a look around at [this shop](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/5700126)

## Wire
Above cable uses YSLY-JZ cable that is heat and oil resistant
We'll need:
* 3 wire that is 6meters for the Wheel angle sensor (0.5mm2 is fine that's 20AWG)
* 2-5 wire that is 2 meters for the push button and some spare for hydraulic lift, work switch, etc (0.5mm2 / 20AWG)
* 2 wire that is 3,5meters for the motor (0.75 - 1mm2 that's 19-18AWG)
* 2 wire that is 1+ meters for the main power input (same as above)
* 3 wire that is 2 meters for the main switch (same as above)

Please note that Hydraulic steering will require extra wires:
Lock pin 2 wires + pressure sensor 2 wires + maybe dedicated 12V for the automotive relay.

# Assembly
Crimp and assemble according to the [Pinout](AIO-Board-Pinout)
### AMPSEAL 23
Here's the [official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXTkm_XV2OY) and here's some [step by step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24bNFu7a9lc)
Things to watch out for:
* The crimped area can't be bigger than the connector itself as it has to go quite deep (try to get a quality crimper choose the head accordingly)
* It has to click when pushed in and from the front it has to be almost flush
* You can disassemble it if that makes it easier

### Main switch

|pin1|pin2|
|----|----|
|ground|ground|
|NC  |NC |
|NC | 12V In |
|Backlight| 12V Out|

### Push button
The middle and one of the outer wires can act as either an NO / NC. Choose the one that connects the wires when pressed.
1 goes steerpin 1 goes ground.

# Validation

Add 12V power to the wiring harness
Turn on the main switch -> does the logo light up?

Connect your sensors, etc and test it in your desk with a spare board
